                <p>Founded in 1968, Silverbroke High School was established with the vision of creating a modern
                    learning environment where academic excellence meets personal growth. What started as a small
                    community school with just 120 students and 12 teachers has grown into one of the regionâ€™s most
                    respected high schools, now welcoming more than 1,200 students each year.

                    Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Silverbroke became known for its strong focus on science, arts, and
                    athletics, producing award-winning debate teams, championship-level sports programs, and innovative
                    science fair projects.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="aboutus-content3">
                <p>In 1995, the school underwent a major campus expansion, adding a state-of-the-art library, science
                    laboratories, and a performing arts center, further solidifying its reputation as a hub of
                    creativity and knowledge.

                    With the rise of technology in the 2000s, Silverbroke High School embraced digital learning,
                    introducing smart classrooms, coding programs, and international exchange partnerships with schools
                    across Europe and Asia.</p>

            <div class="aboutus-content5">
                <p>Today, Silverbroke High School continues to uphold its founding values: excellence, innovation, and
                    community. Our alumni include leaders, artists, entrepreneurs, and scholars who continue to shape
                    the world around them.

                    At Silverbroke, we believe that education is not only about preparing students for exams but also
                    about preparing them for life.</p>
